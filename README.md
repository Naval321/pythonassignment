# python assignment
print() function in python is used to print on the output 
input() function is used to take input from the user ,
but by default input taken via input function
are  of str type  , hence typecasting is required.
int() : converts a given type to int type.
str() : converts a given type to str type.
in python , we do not require to specify data type during
variable declaration , since python is a dynamic programming
language.
